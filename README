NTK/Unit is a minimalistic yet easily extensible unit testing framework.
The whole framework is self-contained in a single documented header file, 
and thus can be used without any library installation.

The code is designed to be portable and only use the standard c++ headers,
and does not make use of RTTI functions.

It notably features:
- Test fixtures
- Test suites (with possible subsuites)
- Exception handling (with support for system exceptions, i.e. signals)
- Global timing
- Customizable reporting
- Simple and very compact syntax with the use of macros
- A bunch of assertions macros covering most needs

This release contains 2 files:
- test.hpp         : the testing framework.
- test_example.cpp : a unit test example testing all the framework functions
                     using itself.

The code has only been tested on MacOS X 10.6 with GCC 4.2 for now, but 
should compile on any recent platform.

NTK/Unit is released under the MIT license.
